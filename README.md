# rust-app

A Rust 1.83 consumer of
**[`flags-2-env`](https://github.com/ORESoftware/flags-2-env)**.

This is a test fixture in the
[`flags-2-env-test`](https://github.com/flags-2-env-test) organization, one of
twelve. Each one ships a byte-identical [`.cli-flags.toml`](.cli-flags.toml) and
asserts a byte-identical parse result, so a binding that drifts from the C core
fails loudly and in isolation.

**The library source is not here.** It lives at
[github.com/ORESoftware/flags-2-env](https://github.com/ORESoftware/flags-2-env)
and is vendored into this repo, unmodified, at
`.vendor/.zed/oresoftware/flags-2-env`.

## Run it

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/flags-2-env-test/rust-app
cd rust-app
docker build -t f2e-fixture-rust .
docker run --rm f2e-fixture-rust
```

The container is the test. It exits non-zero if any assertion in
[`EXPECTED.md`](EXPECTED.md) fails.

## How the dependency is declared

[`.zpkg.toml`](.zpkg.toml) is the declaration of record:

```toml
[install]
dir = ".vendor/.zed"
adapter = "rust"

[dependencies]
"oresoftware/flags-2-env" = "^0.2.0"
```

`zed install` materializes that dependency at
`.vendor/.zed/oresoftware/flags-2-env`. A **git submodule is pinned at that
exact path** as the offline stand-in, which is what lets `docker build .`
succeed with no registry reachable and what lets CI run without bootstrapping
the `zed` CLI first. The two mechanisms write to the same location on purpose —
they are interchangeable, and pointing them at different directories is the
mistake this layout is designed to avoid.

The org segment in the dependency key is `oresoftware`, lowercase. That is the
`org` field of the publisher's own `.zpkg.toml` upstream, which is *not* the
same string as the GitHub owner (`ORESoftware`) and not this org.

## What it asserts

See [EXPECTED.md](EXPECTED.md) for the full contract. In short, given

```
demo --port 8181 --debug=t --mode production
```

every runtime must produce

```
APP_ENV=production
COLOR=true
DEBUG=true
PORT=8181
```

`COLOR` was never passed and still appears: `parse` emits declared defaults
alongside overrides. The fixture also asserts that the short form (`-p 8181`),
the alias form (`--env production`), and the `=`-joined form (`--debug=t`) all
collapse to that same map, and that `--no-color` negates a `bool` whose default
is true.

## License

MIT. The vendored library is MIT as well; see its own `LICENSE`.

## What keeps this fixture honest

A consumer fixture is only worth running if a green result rules something out.
Six things here exist to make that true:

**The assertions are proven able to fail.** CI mounts a `.cli-flags.toml` with
one altered default over the real one and requires the container to exit
non-zero. A fixture that passes against a mutated contract is not reaching the
parser, and its green run means nothing — so that case is a CI failure, not a
curiosity.

**The base image is pinned by digest.** These twelve images exist to answer one
question: did the library change behavior. A floating base tag adds a second
possible cause for a red build that looks exactly like the first.

**The dependency resolution is locked.** `cargo --locked`, `dart pub get
--enforce-lockfile`, and a committed Gleam `manifest.toml` where each applies.
An unpinned transitive dependency is one more thing that can turn this red
without the library having moved.

**The flag contract is checked against an organization-wide digest.** Each
fixture carries the sha256 of the `.cli-flags.toml` all twelve share and fails
if its own copy has drifted. The cross-repository half of that check lives in
`downstream-consumers.yml` upstream, which fetches all twelve and proves they
are one file — because twelve repositories edited together could otherwise stay
self-consistent while agreeing on nothing real.

**The submodule pin is proven to be a published commit.** A submodule can point
at any commit that exists anywhere, including on a fork or an abandoned branch.
CI fetches the pinned sha from `ORESoftware/flags-2-env` by name and fails if
the canonical repository does not have it.

**The container runs as a non-root user.** Nothing here needs root at runtime.
A fixture that quietly required it would be encoding a permission assumption
that real consumers of this library do not share.

The Dockerfile is linted with `hadolint`; `.hadolint.yaml` records which rules
are waived and why.

## Running the checks yourself

```bash
# the fixture itself
docker build -t f2e-fixture-rust .
docker run --rm f2e-fixture-rust

# prove it can fail
sed 's/^default = 3000$/default = 3001/' .cli-flags.toml > /tmp/mutant.toml
docker run --rm -v /tmp/mutant.toml:/app/.cli-flags.toml:ro f2e-fixture-rust
# ^ this one must exit non-zero
```
